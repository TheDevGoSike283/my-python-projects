# my-python-projects
Welcome to TheDevGoSike283's Python3 projects! There will be a heading for each of the projects describing them.
<h2>USA.py</h2>
This is a USA flag made with the maplotlib library which you need to install. When you run the program it will generate the plot of the USA flag.
<h2>wordle.py</h2>
You probably know the word game "Wordle", right? Well, I was able to recreate that game in Python with a fixed array of words, not all the five letter words existing. There are no libraries needed to install.
<h2>typed.py</h2>
For this one, you have to type a sentence and it will imitate a typing animation and print 0.1 seconds between letters.
<h2>palindrome_check_concept.py</h2>
The name is pretty self-explanatory. Type in an input and it will check if it is a palindrome.
<h2>anagram.py</h2>
Type in multiple inputs and they will get sorted into groups of anagrams.
<h2>indian_flag.py</h2>
This one also requires the matplotlib library and is just like the USA flag but it's an Indian flag.
<h2>picker.py</h2>
This program picks a random input from the array you give.
<h2>piano</h2>
This project's README will be in that folder.
<h2>lcm.py and gcf.py</h2>
These programs calculate the lowest common multiple and greatest common factor of your two numbers.
<h2>lineareqsolver.py</h2>
This is a linear equation solver and the linear equations have to be in the form ax + by + c = 0.
